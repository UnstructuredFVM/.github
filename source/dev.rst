Developer Guide
===============

The developer guide is currently available in PDF form `here <https://unstructuredfvm.github.io/docs/ufvm_dev.pdf>`_.


Contributing
------------

To contribute to uFVM solver development please use the following steps:

1. Clone the solver repository (on your local system) as shown in :ref:`Cloning the Solvers <clonesolver>`.
2. Create a new branch in your cloned repository.
3. Make changes / contributions in your new branch.
4. Submit your changes by creating a Pull Request to the ``master`` branch of the solver repository.

.. note::

   Currently the Solver's source code is not open to public. If you are interested in contributing to the project you can :ref:`contact <contact>` the authors and gain access to the GitHub repositories.

Cumulated contributions in the ``master`` branch will be included in a new release.


Future Projects
---------------

1. The present solver is limited to 2-D planar flowfield which can be enhanced by adding 2-D axisymmetry flowfield.
2. Implementing Runge-Kutta scheme to achieve higher order temporal accuracy.
3. The solverâ€™s potential can be further improved by adapting it to the 3-D domain.
4. Implementing Machine-Learning algoritms to improve the solvers predictability.
